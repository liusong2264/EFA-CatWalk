MATLAB-EFA-software Instruction

This software is to help researchers complete an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) based Coordinated Functional Index (CFI), an overall systematic assessment of CatWalk data following thoracic spinal cord contusion in rats, as described in detail in the publications by Guangzhi Ning, Song Liu, Cong Xing et al. This method was obtained by exploratory factor analysis of gait data from three different severity SCI groups (mild, moderate and severe) as well as sham control animals. The formula provided in the code is a simplified version of the factor score for Factor 1 (Coordination), which explains the most variance in EFA. This simplified version is a weighted combination of 11 gait parameters, also known as CFI-SE, whose reliability for locomotor function assessment has been demonstrated.

Before entering the CatWalk parameters, each parameter needs to be standardized, and the standardized formula is: 

Normalized data = (Raw data-mean)/standard deviation
