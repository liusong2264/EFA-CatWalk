This software is a simplified version of exploratory factor analysis. Only indicators related to F1 (factor loading of F1 > 0.7) are selected, which have been shown to be effective (data not shown).

Before entering the CatWalk parameters, each parameter needs to be standardized, and the standardized formula is: 

Normalized data = (Raw data-mean)/standard deviation
